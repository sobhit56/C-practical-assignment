# C-practical-assignment

📖 About

This repository contains C language programs written for learning, practice, and academic purposes.
Each program focuses on a specific concept of C programming, helping beginners understand both theory and practical implementation.

The programs cover fundamental to intermediate concepts such as input/output, control structures, functions, arrays, strings, pointers, and more.

🔄 New programs will be added over time with different objectives and problem types.
