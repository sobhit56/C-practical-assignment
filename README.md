# 📘 C Programming Repository

## 📖 About
This repository contains **C language programs** written for learning, practice, and academic purposes.  
Each program focuses on a specific concept of C programming, such as input/output, conditions, loops, functions, arrays, pointers, and more.[web:202][web:204]

New programs will be added over time with different objectives and problem types.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Basic input/output (`printf`, `scanf`)  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Functions (user-defined and library functions)  
- Menu-driven programs  
- Number-based and math programs  
- Logical and pattern-printing problems  
- Arrays, strings, and pointers (in related files)  
- And more topics to be added gradually[web:202][web:204][web:206]

## 📂 How to Use This Repository

1. Open any `.c` file in your code editor or IDE.  
2. Read the program **aim/comment** at the top to understand the concept.  
3. Compile and run the program using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc` or any IDE).  
4. Modify the code, change inputs, and experiment to strengthen your understanding of C.[web:202][web:215]
